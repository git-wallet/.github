Gitwallet is a new platform for developers to launch & grow a business alongside an open source project. You can use it at [**https://app.gitwallet.co**](https://app.gitwallet.co).

With Gitwallet, you can quickly:
1.  Set up a commercial offering tied to a GitHub project, like paid support, consulting or training.
2.  Promote your commercial services with customizable landing Pages & embeds.
3.  Understand how people are using your open source, using new research and analytics tools.
4.  Manage & grow your customer base with built-in CRM , reporting and contract management. .

We believe serious open source teams need new tools - to help them build strong businesses and ecosystems around their projects. We believe in bringing together maintainers and the companies that depend on their software in new ways. And we don't have to *believe* that the means of making software itself being transformed - that's already happening in front of us. We're entering a brave new world.

If you're interested in what we're building, join our [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/ZdSpS4BuGd), or find us on X as [**@gitwallet**](https://x.com/gitwallet).
